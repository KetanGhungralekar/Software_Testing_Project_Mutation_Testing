1 — High-level strategy (priority order)

Inspect surviving mutants first

Open the PIT HTML report, go to each package → surviving mutants list. For each surviving mutant, PIT shows the mutated line, mutation type, and stack trace. Fix tests to kill those exact mutants.

Increase assertion density & specificity

Many surviving mutants are killed by additional assertions (checking return value, side effects, exceptions, state). Tests that only exercise code but don’t assert will not kill many mutants.

Add boundary and negative tests

Many mutators flip conditionals or off-by-one changes. Add boundary cases (empty, single-element, max/min, negatives) to reveal those errors.

Use whitebox-focused tests to target mutation operators

E.g., for CONDITIONALS_BOUNDARY and NEGATE_CONDITIONALS, write tests asserting both true/false outcomes of condition branches.

Integration tests: assert intermediate states & side-effects

Integration tests often only check final output; assert intermediate steps (result of sorting before filtering, intermediate pipeline state) and interactions (calls to collaborators using spies/mocks) to kill integration-level mutants.
